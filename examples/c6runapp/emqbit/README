Here is some code we used for benchmarking purposes. The idea is to be
able to compare the speed of floating point operations with different
setups (Kernels, compilers, etc).

Bugs, doubts, patches and suggestions to info@emqbit.com.

Thanks :)

In this article we didn't talk about soft-float builds. It is still
useful. It could have been better... we know, we know.

This source was only slightly modified to compile under the DSPEasy 
framework due to lack of gettimeofday function under DSP/Bios.

Makefile was replaced to build both ARM and DSP versions.
