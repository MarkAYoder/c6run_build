Description:
  Exercise the C6RUN_MEM APIs to verify that allocating, deallocating, 
  reallocating and passing data to and from the DSP works as expected.
Tests:
  C6RUN_MEM APIs for robustness and functionality and also tests the 
  correct cache operations from buffer look ups.
Expected Result:
  Functions with buffer/vector args can be compiled through C6RunLib framework
  and called successfully.
